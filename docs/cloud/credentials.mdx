title: "Adding Workspace Credentials"
---

## Overview

As an SDF Cloud administrator, AWS and Snowflake credentials can be set within the console settings.

Before you can set your credentials on the SDF Cloud, you'll first need to authenticate with the platform and have a workspace available or pushed to the cloud. 

<Note>
The SDF Cloud is only available with the **Plus** plan or above at this time. If you'd like to get access, please [sign up here](https://console.sdf.com/welcome).

## Steps to Upload Credentials

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Settings and Select Your Workspace">
        - Once logged in, locate and [click on 'Settings'](https://console.sdf.com/catalog/settings) in the navigation menu. Make sure you're in the workspace you'd like to add credentials to.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a Credential">
        - Click on the 'Create Credential' button.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure Credential Details">
        - Name the credential and add an optional description. The name must be unique, and can only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, or dots.
        <Note>
        The name of your credential must be the same name that is also specified in your `workspace.sdf.yml` for compilation to succeed. If there is no name specified in the `workspace.sdf.yml` you will need to name your credential `default`. 
        </Note>
        - Select the credential type. Currently, we support two providers: AWS Credentials and Snowflake Credentials.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Fill out the Required Fields for you Selected Provider:">
        1. **AWS Credentials**
            - **Required Fields**: Access Key ID, Secret Access Key
            - **Optional Fields**: Region, Role ARN
        2. **Snowflake Credentials**
            - **Required Fields**: Account ID, Username, Password or Private Key PEM
            - **Optional Fields**: Role, Warehouse, Private Key Passphrase
        3. **BigQuery Credentials**
            - **Required Fields**: Project ID, Client Email, Private Key
        <Note>
        - Utilize the Role ARN field if you'd like the credential to assume a specific role. 
        - When using Private Key PEM or Private Key, delimeted and non-delimeted keys are supported.
        </Note>
        Once you have filled in the required fields, you will be able to click 'Complete'.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Recompile">
        - After adding credentials, you may need to recompile your workspace to see the changes reflected. To do this, [navigate to the top of your workspace page](https://console.sdf.com/catalog/settings) and select "Recompile".
    </Step>

[Snowflake Getting Started Guide](/integrations/snowflake/getting-started) or the [Redshift Getting Started Guide](/integrations/aws/redshift/getting-started).
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Required Fields**: Ensure all required fields are filled in for the selected credential type.
- **Credential Not Saving**: Check for any error messages and ensure all fields are correctly filled.
- **Workspace Failed to Compile:** [Check the logs for your workspace](https://console.sdf.com/catalog/logs/default) to find more extensive information on why compilation failed. If your workspace fails to compile and youâ€™ve integrated with Github, you may need to re-sync with Github or recompile your workspace first.
