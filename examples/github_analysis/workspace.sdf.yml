    This workspace uses a free dataset on Snowflake's marketplace called Cybersyn Tech & Innovation Essentials. 
    Running and compiling this workspace requires a connection to a Snowflake account with the dataset above installed.
    The provider in this workspace is using the `default` credentials. Run sdf auth login snowflake with no name provided to set these.

    The analysis in this workspace is focused on the GitHub data available through this free dataset. It's a more advanced, in-depth analysis
    in comparison to the cybersyn_tech_innovation sample workspace. That being said, by default it materializes views to the same `sdf_snowflake`
    database as the cybersyn_tech_innovation workspace.
